# tevi_carthief

This is a simple script, it is about a gang member that gives you missions to steal vehicles, when you go with the gang member and hit the E key (By default) a blip will be added to the map with the position of a moving vehicle, you will have to go find the vehicle and take it to the gang member
(Spawns and models are random, predefined in config.lua)
